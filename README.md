# vegova-render-esp32
will render the vegova logo to SSD1306 display or any adafruit gfx compatible display

note: this is a point cloud renderer, it samples in this case an image and renders it.
I've put in some horrible depth buffer support for oclusion, but i don't really use it!
If you wish to expand upon this project, i wish you good luch

*this is a school project and i don't have time to create a usefull readme*
